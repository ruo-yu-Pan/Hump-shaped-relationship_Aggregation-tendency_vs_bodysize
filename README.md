# Hump-shaped relationship between aggregation tendency and body size within fish populations
 
This repository is an implementaion of the research work *Hump-shaped relationship between aggregation tendency and body size within fish populations*.

The repository contains:
- Source code

Raw data including fishery survey data, sea bottom tempeature (SBT), and fishing mortality can be downloaded on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4008438) or at the links provided in the paper. 
* Raw data for sea surface temperature (SST) is too big to upload. If you need the raw SST data, Please download it at the links provided in the paper (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html).
